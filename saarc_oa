 Charter of Forum for Open Access in SAARC

1.	We collectively coordinate and develop a framework for Open Access in South Asia/SAARC.
2.	We agree with the Joint COAR-UNESCO Statement on Open Access and will work for the alternative system in which both the author and the reader need not pay any charges.
3.	We advocate for the practice of Open Science (sharing tools, methods and results (data)).
4.	We adopt the Free and Open Source tools and innovative technologies for the development of models for sharing scholarship. 
5.	We will garner support of the relevant stakeholders (students/scholars, journal editorial teams, university libraries, state libraries, public authorities in charge of dissemination of scholarship in higher education and other stakeholders) for spearheading the Open Access movement.
6.	We will take forward the concept of Open Access to further bring all the publicly funded research outputs (not limited to journal literature alone) to be freely available to the public to use and re-use for the public good. 
7.	We will draft National Policies for Open Access and formulate country-specific action plans for making Open Access as default by 2030/250 thus making all the publicly funded research in South Asia (SAARC Countries) publicly/freely available to the public through the Internet.
8.	We will practice and encourage the researchers and the scientists to adopt openness in peer-reviewing and other editorial services.
9.	We will work for an alternate reward system in recognition and promotion not in terms of the ‘Impact Factor’ of the journals, but the ‘Impact’ of the articles/scholarship in the science and the society.
